    "\n",
    "Answer: In case of append , it always add element to the last position of the list but in the other side by using insert we can define the index where we want to add the new element. insert function takes two argument one is index position and next is the element to be added. \n",

    "Answer: pop and remove.\n",

    "\n",
    "we can use 'clear' function to remove all the elements at one go in the list.\n",

    "Answer: Indexing operation is supported by both string values and list values."
